# patch-generator-action DEMO

This repo demonstrates the [patch-generator-action][] reusable GitHub Action.
When your pull request contains automatically-fixable issues, rather
than requiring you to run the fix command manually, this action will
automatically generate a diff file that you can directly apply to your branch.
